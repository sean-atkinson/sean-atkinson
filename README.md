### Hello stranger who may or may not be stalking me... 👋🏾 

A little about yours truly:

* 🔭 I’m a General Assembly trained data scientist who's currently heavy into all things SQL and data analysis. 

* ⚡ Fun facts about me: 
  * I'm a Liverpool FC supporter
  * I love Formula 1
  * I think grey gloomy weather is the best weather
  * Absurdist humour is my jam
  * My nine-month-old likes to test my devotion to her on a daily basis by placing herself in increasingly dangerous positions
